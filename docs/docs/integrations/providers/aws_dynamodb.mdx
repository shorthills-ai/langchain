# AWS DynamoDB

>[AWS DynamoDB](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/dynamodb/index.html) 
> is a fully managed `NoSQL` database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.
 
## Installation and Setup

We have to configur the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html). 

We need to install the `boto3` library.

```bash
pip install boto3
```


## Memory

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/memory/aws_dynamodb).

```python
from langchain.memory import DynamoDBChatMessageHistory
```
