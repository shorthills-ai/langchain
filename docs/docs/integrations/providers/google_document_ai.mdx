# Google Document AI

>[Document AI](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/overview) is a `Google Cloud Platform` 
> service to transform unstructured data from documents into structured data, making it easier 
> to understand, analyze, and consume.  


## Installation and Setup

You need to set up a [`GCS` bucket and create your own OCR processor](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/create-processor)  
The `GCS_OUTPUT_PATH` should be a path to a folder on GCS (starting with `gs://`) 
and a processor name should look like `projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION/processors/PROCESSOR_ID`.
You can get it either programmatically or copy from the `Prediction endpoint` section of the `Processor details`
tab in the Google Cloud Console.

```bash
pip install google-cloud-documentai
pip install google-cloud-documentai-toolbox
```

## Document Transformer

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/docai).

```python
from langchain.document_loaders.blob_loaders import Blob
from langchain.document_loaders.parsers import DocAIParser
```
