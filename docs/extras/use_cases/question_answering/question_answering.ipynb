    "# Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/docs/extras/use_cases/question_answering/qa.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use case\n",
    "Suppose you have some text documents (PDF, blog, Notion pages, etc.) and want to ask questions related to the contents of those documents. LLMs, given their proficiency in understanding text, are a great tool for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this walkthrough we'll go over how to build a question-answering over documents application using LLMs. Two very related use cases which we cover elsewhere are:\n",
    "- [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/sql) (e.g., SQL)\n",
    "- [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/code_understanding) (e.g., Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "![intro.png](/img/qa_intro.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The pipeline for converting raw unstructured data into a QA chain looks like this:\n",
    "1. `Loading`: First we need to load our data. Unstructured data can be loaded from many sources. Use the [LangChain integration hub](https://integrations.langchain.com/) to browse the full set of loaders.\n",
    "Each loader returns data as a LangChain [`Document`](/docs/components/schema/document).\n",
    "2. `Splitting`: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break `Documents` into splits of specified size\n",
    "3. `Storage`: Storage (e.g., often a [vectorstore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/)) will house [and often embed](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-embeddings/) the splits\n",
    "4. `Retrieval`: The app retrieves splits from storage (e.g., often [with similar embeddings](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/k-nearest-neighbor/) to the input question)\n",
    "5. `Generation`: An [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/models/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data\n",
    "6. `Conversation` (Extension): Hold a multi-turn conversation by adding [Memory](/docs/modules/memory/) to your QA chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "![flow.jpeg](/img/qa_flow.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you a sneak preview, the above pipeline can be all be wrapped in a single object: `VectorstoreIndexCreator`. Suppose we want a QA app over this [blog post](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/). We can create this in a few lines of code. First set environment variables and install packages:"

Chain of thought (CoT): This approach involves instructing the language model to \"think step by step\" and decompose complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It enhances model performance on complex tasks by utilizing more test-time computation.\\n\\n2. Tree of Thoughts: This approach extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS or DFS, and each state is evaluated by a classifier or majority vote.\\n\\n3. LLM with simple prompting: This approach involves using a language model with simple prompts like \"Steps for XYZ\" or \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\" to perform task decomposition.\\n\\n4. Task-specific instructions: This approach involves providing task-specific instructions to guide the language model in decomposing the task. For example, providing the instruction \"Write a story outline\" for the task of writing a novel.\\n\\n5. Human inputs: Task decomposition can also be done with human inputs, where humans provide guidance and input to break down the task into smaller subtasks.'}"
