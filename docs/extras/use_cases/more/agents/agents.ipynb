    "## Use case \n",
    "\n",
    "LLM-based agents are powerful general problem solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [primary LLM agent components](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) include at least 3 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Planning`: The ability to break down tasks into smaller sub-goals\n",
    "* `Memory`: The ability to retain and recall information\n",
    "* `Tools`: The ability to get information from external sources (e.g., APIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike LLMs simply connected to [APIs](/docs/use_cases/apis/apis), agents [can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWUdGhRrv2c):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Self-correct\n",
    "* Handle multi-hop tasks (several intermediate \"hops\" or steps to arrive at a conclusion)\n",
    "* Tackle long time horizon tasks (that require access to long-term memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image description](/img/agents_use_case_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain has [many agent types](/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly all agents will use the following components:\n",
    " \n",
    "**Planning**\n",
    " \n",
    "* `Prompt`: Can given the LLM [personality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf), context (e.g, via retrieval from memory), or strategies for learninng (e.g., [chain-of-thought](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/#chain-of-thought-cot)).\n",
    "* `Agent` Responsible for deciding what step to take next using an LLM with the `Prompt`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory**\n",
    "\n",
    "* This can be short or long-term, allowing the agent to persist information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tools are functions that an agent can call.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, there are some taxonomic differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Action agents`: Designed to decide the sequence of actions (tool use) (e.g., OpenAI functions agents, ReAct agents).\n",
    "* `Simulation agents`: Designed for role-play often in simulated enviorment (e.g., Generative Agents, CAMEL).\n",
    "* `Autonomous agents`: Designed for indepdent execution towards long term goals (e.g., BabyAGI, Auto-GPT).\n",
    "\n",
    "This will focus on `Action agents`.\n",
